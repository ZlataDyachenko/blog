## Last week

Last week I managed to complete several academic tasks, which I would like to tell you more about.
1. In the discipline "Mathematical foundations of information security and information security", I completed the third laboratory work, the topic of which was encryption by gamming. Implemented encryption using a finite- length gamma üëèüèº
2. She also completed the third laboratory work in the discipline "Scientific Programming", which was aimed at gaining skills in working with Octave.
3. Completed laboratory work on the discipline "Modeling of wireless networks", thanks to which she learned how to apply distributions to transform random variables.
4. She wrote a test paper on the discipline "Additional chapters of queuing theory", in which a mathematical model of a network with unicast connections was considered. To be honest, it wasn't difficult. But in a week there will be another test in this discipline. Wish me luck!

I continue to keep you informed of my academic achievements. Au revoir! üëã
