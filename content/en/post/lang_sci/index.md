**A scientific programming language** is one that is designed and optimized for the use of mathematical formula and matrices.[2] Such languages are characterized not only by the availability of libraries performing mathematical or scientific functions, but by the syntax of the language itself.

## Examples of scientific programming languages

* ALGOT
* APL
* Fortran
* Julia
* Maple
* MATLAB
* R

### Each language has its own peculiarities, and only you decide which one to use.
