## Last week

Last week I managed to complete several academic tasks, which I would like to tell you more about.
1. In the discipline "Mathematical foundations of information security and information security", I completed the second laboratory work, the topic of which was encryption using permutations. The topic of cryptography is very entertaining, and I could write a post about it.
2. She also completed the second laboratory work on the discipline "Scientific Programming", which was aimed at gaining skills to work with the Markdown markup language. If you see this post, it means I'm doing well :)
3. I completed two laboratory works on the discipline "Modeling of wireless networks", thanks to which I remembered the basic methods of working with statistical data in Python.
4. Continued studying French. A little more and this site will have the opportunity to choose French as the language (I'm kidding, I'm still a long way from that, but I can tell you what my name is).

I will keep you informed of my academic achievements. Au revoir! ðŸ‘‹
