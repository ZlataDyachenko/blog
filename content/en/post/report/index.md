**Making a report** is a time-consuming but necessary process.

## Algorithm for creating a report in Markdown

1. Download the report template. The template will greatly simplify the process of creating a report and selecting the best parameters. In the future, you can use your own reports as a template.
2. Select a program to work with Markdown files. I use Atom and I can recommend it to you: a user-friendly interface, the ability to download additional packages (for example, to preview files) and a large selection of themes.
3. Prepare images for the report and always keep the Markdown syntax tab open at hand. You can always forget something.
4. Start creating!
5. Convert the report to the desired format and admire your work.

### How good that there is Markdown.
