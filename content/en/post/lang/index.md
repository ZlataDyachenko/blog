**Lightweight Markup Language** is a markup language with a simple, unobtrusive syntax. In fact, the syntax is so simple that anyone can quickly learn how to use these markup languages. The key advantage of this type of language is that it is designed in such a way that it is easy to enter annotated text in a text editor and at the same time easy to read in raw form.

## Application and Benefits

There are a number of uses for lightweight markup languages. Lightweight markup languages are useful when writing texts, as they allow you to save a lot of time on creating HTML tags manually, speeding up any process related to writing. They are also particularly effective where the reader wants to read the source document as well as the output data. Moreover, lightweight markup languages are often used in web publications, including wikis and blogs.

## Examples

* asciidoc
