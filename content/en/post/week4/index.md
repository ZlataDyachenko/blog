## Last week

It was my mom's birthday last week! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
But I didn't forget about studying either.
1. In the discipline "Mathematical foundations of information protection and information security", I completed the fifth laboratory work, in which it was necessary to implement probabilistic algorithms for checking the simplicity of a number.
2. I also completed the fifth laboratory work in the discipline "Scientific Programming", thanks to which I learned even more about Octave.
3. Wrote the third test paper on the discipline "Additional chapters of queuing theory". Wow, there are so many tests on this subject!

I continue to keep you informed of my academic achievements. Au revoir! ðŸ‘‹
