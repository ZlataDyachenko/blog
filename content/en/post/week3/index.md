## Last week

It was my birthday last week! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰
But I didn't forget about studying either. I managed to complete several academic tasks, which I would like to tell you more about.
1. In the discipline "Mathematical foundations of information protection and information security", I completed the fourth laboratory work, in which it was necessary to implement four algorithms for finding the greatest common divisor. I remembered the school ðŸ‘¶
2. She also completed the fourth laboratory work on the discipline "Scientific Programming", which was aimed at solving systems of linear equations using Octave.
3. Wrote the second test paper on the discipline "Additional chapters of the theory of queuing". Waiting for the results ðŸ¤ž

I continue to keep you informed of my academic achievements. Au revoir! ðŸ‘‹
